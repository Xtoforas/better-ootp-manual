# Why?

[Out of the Park Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/) is a poorly documented game. The [manual](https://manuals.ootpdevelopments.com/) is cryptic, often wrong and is outdated.

The [forums](https://forums.ootpdevelopments.com/) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ootp) is where anyone who is serious about the game can start to go to find information, but unless you're great at searching vBulletin like it's 2001 or know the right sequence of search terms some person back in 2020 posted in #pt21-roster-and-strategy-advice, the game can quickly become frustrating.

Over the years I've collected snippets of "best practices" and instead of keeping them pinned in random chat messages I decided organizing them in a somewhat orderly fashion would make it helpful for new players and help me remember why certain things are the way they are.
