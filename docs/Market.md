# Introduction

In Perfect Team, the currency are Perfect Points. As part of [E6 Nerds United](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHM6ieAMVfsuXz3TxHbPTLHt0W_YbfA8I), Astor31, Durden, and myself did a [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP9KNFZxE8E) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsLgoqTZEN8) of how to generate Perfect Points.

The synopsis of the two videos can be found below.

# How to Generate Perfect Points

Need to consider several factors before deciding which PP generation strategies to employ:
1.  Do you plan to spend money during the cycle to buy PP?  If so, how much?
2.  If you plan on buying points, how will the spending be spread out?
3.  How much time do you plan to spend playing the game?
4.  How is that time distributed?

## Drops

Can get 15-20 packs a week from watching streams on official channel

Can get 35 packs a week from watching affiliate streams

Total of 50-55 packs per week with no effort

## Tournaments

What types of tournament to play - Quicks v. dailies/weeklies

Depends on your:
Schedule
Amount of time working on rosters
Points spent on tournament specific cards

PDs - skip quicks and take the free shots at dailies or weeklies

## Live Spec

During the MLB Season, the ratings of live cards change monthly.  When a card goes up in tier, the QS value increases and you can generate extra perfect points
Buy cards that you think are going to go up

Open packs, then only sell the cards you think are going to go down

## Mission Spec

Most packable cards end up in missions.  Most cards go up significantly in value if they are placed in a mission with a valuable reward
Considerations:
If a card is released and it is explicit that it will be in an imminent future mission (like Plat cards), price may not drop low enough to make spec profitable
Mission spec is a lot about timing.  When a new card drops, that is often the most value the card will ever have regardless of future missions.

## Flipping

Flipping is just buying cards in the AH with the intention of re-selling quickly
Takes points to make points.  Need to save up some points before you can start investing in cards to flip
Use Buy Orders to buy cheap and list for higher.  Helps to have to some guidelines
There are thousands of cards in the AH.  Best to pick a tier of card that makes sense for your budget and then specialize in a subsection of that tier
Best to flip what you know.  If you just finished a mission, you know the market for those cards and thus are more likely to know when/if profit can be made

1.	WARNING - Flipping can be very time-intensive
2.	WARNING - The market for a card (or category of cards) can change very rapidly.  It is very easy for the market to collapse and you get left holding cards that you can’t re-sell at a profit
3. 	WARNING - You can’t always sell the cards right away.  If someone else is determined to sell, you can get into an undercut war and lose out on your profit or get stuck with the card for a while

## Reverse-Flipping

A reverse flip is when you sell a card you own and then buy back for less.

1.	Mission cards - When new missions are released, if you have all the cards needed you can complete the mission and sell right away.  The first couple of sales are usually the highest the card will ever sell for.  You can then wait a few weeks and then buy back for much less.  
2.	Can do the same with a new packable or a tournament reward card

1.	WARNING - not every new card follows the pattern.  There are occasionally new cards that go cheap initially, but then go up in value over time.  Helps to have a good sense of what cards should be worth based on scarcity, league value, tournament value and future mission value
2.	WARNING - It may take a while before it is profitable to buy back, so be careful doing this with a card that you want to use for league/tournaments

## Achievements

In-game achievements are a nominal source of PP (prior versions provided more in-game points)
Still a few ways to maximize PP generation 
Don’t rush to move up quickly when you first start a team.  At launch, teams can jump from entry pool and skip a few levels based on how you do in that initial entry pool.  If you start your team right away, but don’t improve your team while in entry pool you will start in rookie.  You can be accumulating PP and packs from tournaments, streams, flipping, etc. and then upgrade your team to start accumulating achievements in rookie
If you are starting a team later in the cycle, you can speed through the live and other missions to quickly upgrade your team and accumulate a lot of points your 1st couple of weeks


## Buying Points

 Whether to buy points is a personal decision based on your individual life circumstances.  There is no real life return on any investment of points made. 
 
If you are going to buy points, here are some considerations:
Points purchased early in the season have way more value than points bought later on
Points purchased in bulk provide greater value than buying a small amount each week/month

## Buying Packs

DON’T

Generally speaking, buying packs are a losing proposition.  There are times when new chase cards come out where packs are mathematically EV positive, but requires getting one of those chase cards to make a pack rip profitable.

One time that packs are definitely profitable is when the game 1st launches.  Live cards have significant value and just about everything will sell at a premium
